The purpose of this repo is to show an extremly simple example of how neural netowork backpropagation can be coded.

See shallow_network.py for the simplist example. This is a shallow network so it contains no hidden layers.

See deep_network.py for a more complex example. This is a deep network with one hidden layer.
