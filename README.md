This repo shows an extremly simple example of how neural netowork backpropagation can be coded.

See `src/shallow_network.py` for the simplist example. This is a shallow network so it contains no hidden layers.

See `src/deep_network.py` for a more complex example. This is a deep network with one hidden layer.
